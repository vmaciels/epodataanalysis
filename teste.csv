CONSTITUTION:A mixture of silica and carbon (with or without seed powder) is heated in a gaseous mixture of NH3 and a gaseous hydrocarbon (CmHn). A gas capable of forming a hydrocarbon in a synthesis atmosphere is included in the gaseous hydrocarbon. The carbon content in the Si3N4 powder can be remarkably reduced by this method. The CO generated in the reaction process is removed by the reaction of CO and NH3. The generated C also reacts with NH3 and is removed. Since the CO and C are thus removed as gaseous CH4 or gaseous C2H2, C is not mixed into the Si3N4 to be synthesized.

CONSTITUTION:When an output from an output control circuit 11 is the 'H' and the output from a sense amplifier 10 is changed from the 'H' to the 'L', a current to flow from a data output terminal 5 up to a grand is made into the sum of a current i1 of an N-MOS 7 and a current i2 of an N-MOS 8. The current i1 is started to flow along with the change of a NOR output signal (b), and the peak value is restricted. Since the current i2 is started to flow along with the change of a rise delaying NOR output signal (c), it is started to flow after a delay (due to the operation of a rise delaying circuit 6) without being started to flow at the same time as the current i1.

CONSTITUTION:After a semiconductor chip 5 is arranged in a film 8, etc., of an insulating material wherein a wiring material 3 is patterned, the wiring material 3 and an inner lead pin 1 of a lead frame are bonded by bonding wire 4; thereby, an area of a semiconductor chip is reduced and economy is improved in comparison with that the pin 1 and the chip 5 are bonded directly."
998,35953601,en,"PURPOSE:To change current density distribution on an electrostatic charging device side so that electrostatically charged amount supplied to a photosensitive drum can be changed by moving current density distribution member disposed in a shielding case between the peripheral surface of the shielding case and wire. CONSTITUTION:Since an insulating body 4 is rotated and moved to a position which is far from the wire 3, much higher current density is concentrated near both sides right and left of the shielding case 2. Therefore, the current density toward the surface side of the photosensitive drum 54 from the open surface 21 of the case 2 is relatively lowered and the electrostatically charged amount of the drum 54 is decreased. On the other hand, the insulating body 4 is rotated and moved to right end position which is close distance from the wire 3, the current having high density toward the right end position is cut off, so that the current is separated to the one toward the center side of the peripheral surface of the case 2 and to the one toward the surface of the drum 54. However, the center side of the peripheral surface of the case 2 is farther distance, much of the cutoff current is toward the drum 54 side from the open part 21, so that the current density toward the surface side of the drum 54 relatively rises and the electrostatically charged amount of the drum 54 is increased."
999,35953602,en,"PURPOSE:To provide a noise canceling circuit to constantly obtain the quality of the reproducing picture of a high grade even when the characteristics of used tapes are different. CONSTITUTION:The noise canceling circuit removing noise from a reproducing video signal is provided with a high pass filter 1 extracting the high frequency component of the reproducing video signal, a limiter 2 amplitude-limiting the output of the high pass filter 1, a subtracter 6 taking difference between the output of the limiter 2 and a signal bypassing the limiter 2, a comparator 9 comparing the output level of the subtracter 6 and the reference level and a microcomputer 10 judging the output of the comparator 9 to control the level of the limiter 2."
